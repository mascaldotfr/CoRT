# WARSTATUS

There is no such things as a public API for the war status, so that part has to
be run server side for CoRT, due to NGE not allowing cross origin request
([CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)).

`warstatus.php` fetches the official war status page and dump the gems/forts
status in a file as JSON (see `outfile` in `warstatus.php`). It's used only
through the PHP CLI, it will return HTTP 403 if called through a browser.

You can see it in action at https://cort.thebus.top/api/var/warstatus.json --
informations are refreshed every minute.

The `stats` directory includes the code used to generate the WZ statistics, and
has its own README, but also needs `warstatus.php` to work in order to generate
statistics.

## Response Format

Note that the API is [static](https://www.seancdavis.com/posts/lets-talk-about-static-apis/).

Clearly the format has been optimized for display on the site and try to play
well with NGE inconsistent website code, sacrificing a bit of the consistency.

## EXPLOITATION EXAMPLES

### Javascript

* See `../js/wz.js`

### Python

* See `./demos/ro_status.py`. It requires the "blessed" module to be installed. It
  displays all elements that you can find on the website but the map in a
  terminal in barely 100 lines of code.

## BUGS

The code is terrible, and so is the original webpage :P
