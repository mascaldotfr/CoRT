# WARSTATUS

There is no such things as a public API for the war status, so that part has to
be run server side for CoRT, due to NGE not allowing cross origin request
([CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)).

`warstatus.py` fetches the official war status page and dump the gems/forts
status in a file as JSON (see `outfile` in `warstatus.py`). The official map
isn't fetched, because it has a static URL and CoRT actually draws one using
HTML5 canvas for speed and bandwidth economy (NGE's site is slow).

You can see it in action at https://hail.thebus.top/CoRT/warstatus/warstatus.json --
informations are refreshed every minute.

The `stats` directory includes the code used to generate the WZ statistics, and
has its own README, but also needs `warstatus.py` to work in order to generate
statistics.

## Requirements

- Python 3 (with beautifulsoup4; `python3-bs4` in debian packages). Unlike
  `/collect` written in PHP, I chose python because `warstatus.py` needs to run
  every minute, something that is rarely proposed by standard webhosting offers
  and is a call for using a VPS. Also I'm more fluent in python than PHP
  nowadays, and has almost all the batteries included for the job.
- A server running Linux (it will work on Windows through different means but I
  don't use it), performance and storage doesn't matter (it currently runs on
  1CPU/512MB RAM/10G SSD VPS!)
- A web server that is able to serve static files and where CORS is enabled
  (see https://enable-cors.org/server.html), **unless** you serve CoRT and this
  "API endpoint" (*ahem*) on the same domain

## Deployment

While it's very flexible, if you serve the API and the website in the same
place it's recommended to put the whole repository in a place accessible by
your webserver. It's easier to update and anyway the API doesn't deal with
sensitive content (credentials etc.).

1. Put this directory in some place on your server. Ensure that place can be
   written by the user that will execute `warstatus.py` and can be accessed by
   your webserver. You can change the various `outfile` variables in
   `warstatus.py` to make it a different place.
2. Log in as this user, then edit their crontab:
	```
	crontab -e
	```
3. Add the following line:
	```
	* * * * * /where/is/warstatus.py
	```
4. Modify `js/api_url.js` with your own urls

That's it.

## Response Format

Note that the API is [static](https://www.seancdavis.com/posts/lets-talk-about-static-apis/).

Clearly the format has been optimized for display on the site and try to play
well with NGE inconsistent website code, sacrificing a bit of the consistency.

## EXPLOITATION EXAMPLES

### Javascript

* See `../js/wz.js`

### Python

* See `./demos/ro_status.py`. It requires the "blessed" module to be installed. It
  displays all elements that you can find on the website but the map in a
  terminal in barely 100 lines of code.

## BUGS

The code is terrible, and so is the original webpage :P
