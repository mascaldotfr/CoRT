# Deploy CoRT

## Intro

Note that this documentation targets Unix-like systems (macOS, Linux, BSD
etc.). CoRT's frontend and API can run locally on Windows 11 through XAMPP, but
it's not detailed due to the added complexity.

Also we're using the `3.2.0` release through the doc for *managed*,
*integrated* and *noapi* setups, so you'll need to adapt to the latest release
seen at https://codeberg.org/mascal/CoRT/releases

## Index

There are several documented ways to install CoRT:

1. [Without API](README.noapi.md) -- very easy
2. [With API, on managed webhosting](README.managed.md) -- easy
3. [With API, integrated in an already running server](README.integrated.md) -- intermediate
4. [With API using Docker, or any new server](README.vps.md) -- advanced, use development version by default
