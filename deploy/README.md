# Deploy CoRT

## Intro

Note that this documentation targets Unix-like systems (macOS, Linux, BSD
etc.). CoRT *should* run on Windows through XAMPP and by using the managed
webhosting guide using powershell or by hand, which is not detailed.

Also we're using the `1.35.19-2.0rc1` release through the doc for *managed*,
*integrated* and *noapi* setups, so you'll need to adapt to the latest release
seen at https://github.com/mascaldotfr/CoRT/releases/latest

## Index

There are several documented ways to install CoRT:

1. [Without API](README.noapi.md) -- very easy
2. [With API, on managed webhosting](README.managed.md) -- easy
3. [With API, integrated in an already running server](README.integrated.md) -- intermediate
4. [With API using Docker, or any new server](README.vps.md) -- advanced, use development version by default
